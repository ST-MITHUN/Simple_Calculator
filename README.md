# Simple Calculator (Java Practice Project)

##  Project Description

This is a basic **Simple Calculator** built using Java. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

This project was created as part of my **1st Semester practice project** to understand the fundamentals of Java â€” including variables, conditionals, methods, loops, and user input.

##  Features

- User-friendly console-based interface
- Supports basic arithmetic operations
- Repeats until the user decides to exit

##  Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17)
- Command-line interface (CLI)

##  Learning Outcome

Through this project, I learned:

- How to take input from the user in Java
- How to use `if-else` and `switch` statements
- How to perform arithmetic operations
- How to display formatted output
